# Tips and Tricks for using Markdown

There's a bunch of top tips when it comes to using markdown files.

## Keyboard tags

Did you know, you can use tags to make text look like buttons?

Use the "kbd" tag and any text you wrap in this tag will look like a button. Note, the button is NOT interactable.

**Examples**

<kbd>Boss</kbd>

Press the <kbd>ESC</kbd> to exit out for the window.

Another great keyboard shortcut is quickly navigating to your issues by typing <kbd>g</kbd><kbd>i</kbd> on your keyboard.

## Nitty gritty details

When writing or commenting on issues/pull requests, sometimes it can be very distracting to write a whole lot of information in one go. Or if you want to log an error in your issue/PR, the error log can take up a whole lot of room. You can use the "summary" and "details" tags to wrap your long descriptions in an expandable format.

**Example**

We found the following error log:
<details>
mod_logio:
Adds three new logging formats to the mod_log_config format specifications, including byte quantities received, sent, and transferred (combination of received and sent quantities). Normally included in the base Apache compile.
LogIOTrackTTFB: Enables time tracking between the initial request read time and the moment the first byte response is sent.

mod_filter: Provides context-sensitive filters to the output chain by registering any number of filter providers. mod_filter is not specific to logging, but allows for extracting specific requests based on the filter provider. Context containers include: main apache config, vhost config, within directory tags, and .htaccess files.

Employing this module allows for filtering requests containing such things as certain injection criteria and which IP address itâ€™s from.

This module is provided by default in many of the package distributions, but may require enabling. For the purposes of logging, the FilterTrace directive posts information to the error log. Directives include:

AddOutputFilterByType: Assigns an output filter to a particular media type.
FilterChain: Configures a filter chain.
FilterDeclare: Declares a smart filter.
FilterProtocol: Causes the mod_filter to handle response headers correctly.
FilterProvider: Registers filter providers.
FilterTrace: Allows for debugging/diagnostic information to an error log prior to provider processing.

Example: Filtering in a vhost context container conditionally on filter and include modules:

[quote] #Declare a resource type filter: FilterDeclare xss #Register a provider: FilterProvider xss INCLUDES %{REQUEST_FILENAME}="(/[<>]+)$" #FilterProvider ... #Build the chain: FilterChain xss #Declare a custom log: CustomLog /var/www/log/xss.log xss #Format the log entry: LogFormat "%h %u %t "%r" %>s "%{Referer}i" "%{User-Agent}i"" xss [/quote]

mod_unique_id:
Constructs an environment variable and a unique identifier for each request. Often included in package distributions but may require enabling. This unique identifier is written to the access log.

This module has been superseded by mod_log_forensic for forensic purposes, but is still supported for others.

Unlike the forensic identifier, the unique identifier is passed to the application handler via the environment variable UNIQUE_ID. This allows application developers to trace a request through the web server to the application server. It can be useful for debugging a request.

Apache spins off child processes to handle requests, and a child instance processes several requests at a time. As a result, it is sometimes desirable to use a unique identifier to identify a single request across multiple server instances and child processes.

Once enabled, the module provides an identifier by default to the application handler.

Example:

[quote]UNIQUE_ID: Vaf3en8AAQEAAAtoQlAAAAAA[/quote]

The identifier is constructed from a 32-bit IP address, 32-bit process ID, 32-bit timestamp coupled to a 16-bit counter for tighter resolution than a single-second, 32-bit thread index. The timestamp component is UTC to prevent issues with daylight saving time adjustments. The application handler should treat the identifier as an opaque token only and not dissected into constituents.

</details>

Now your issue/PR is all nice and tidy.

NOTE: the summary will flyout at the end of your issue/comment/PR. Ie. if you have other text below this, your summary and details tag will be expanded below this. Give it a try by clicking on here:

<details>
Lots of words can appear here.
<summary>Click here to see an example (scroll to the bottom on the readme.md file)


If you don't want this to happen, close your summary tag and everything will be shown directly below your summary line. Don't forget to close your "details" tag as well.

## Diff viewer

We recently showed you how to view [differences in 3D images](https://twitter.com/github/status/1366523816541904897). You can also use backticks to view diff in markdown.

Negative (-) will show in red, Positive (+) will show in green.

**Example**

````diff
MISH's Live stream
- lots of people came today
+ lots more people came today!
````

Now you can quickly show differences in code.

## HEX colour codes

You can also show hex colour codes in markdown. Use backticks to enter the colour code, and a coloured tile will appear.

_NOTE: this is no longer a feature. Hex colour codes will appear as code, but will no longer have a coloured tile to accompany them._

**Example**

We should definitely use Crimson: `#DC143C` as our logo colour.

Here are the colours used in the GitHub contribution graphs: `#C6E48B` `#7AC96F` `#249A3C` `#196127`
