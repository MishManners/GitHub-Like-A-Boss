# Tips and Tricks for using Markdown

There's a bunch of top tips when it comes to using markdown files.

## Keyboard tags

Did you know, you can use tags to make text look like buttons?

Use the "kbd" tag and any text you wrap in this tag will look like a button. Note, the button is NOT interactable.

**Examples**

<kbd>Boss</kbd>

Press the <kbd>ESC</kbd> to exit out for the window.

Another great keyboard shortcut is quickly navigating to your issues by typing <kbd>g</kbd><kbd>i</kbd> on your keyboard.
