# Tips and Tricks for using Markdown

There's a bunch of top tips when it comes to using markdown files.

## Keyboard tags

Did you know, you can use tags to make text look like buttons?

Use the "kbd" tag and any text you wrap in this tag will look like a button. Note, the button is NOT interactable.

**Examples**

<kbd>Boss</kbd>

Press the <kbd>ESC</kbd> key to exit out of the window.

Another great keyboard shortcut is quickly navigating to your issues by typing <kbd>g</kbd><kbd>i</kbd> on your keyboard when you are in a repository.

## Nitty Gritty details

When writing or commenting on issues/pull requests, sometimes it can be very distracting to write a whole lot of information in one go. Or you might want to log an error in your issue/PR, and this can take up a lot of space. You can use the "summary" and "details" tags to wrap your long descriptions in an expandable format.
