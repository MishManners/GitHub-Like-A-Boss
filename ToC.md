# Table of Contents

A table of contents is automatically generated when you use at least two
or more headings in a markdown file.

## Sub heading number 1

Each heading will be used in the table of contents, and all
six headings can be used.

### Less important information

#### A fourth sub heading

##### The super less important stuff here

###### Who even uses heading number six? ðŸ˜œ

The headings will form the table and the table of contents will
be indented based on the headings.
